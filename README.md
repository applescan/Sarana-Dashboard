<h4>About This Project</h4>

Welcome to **Sarana Point of Sales System**! Tailored specifically for my parent's shop, Sarana addresses the challenges of their previous complex system by offering a streamlined, easy-to-use interface. Designed for handling cash payments and simplified needs, Sarana is your go-to solution for efficient point-of-sale management.

<h4>Why is This Problem Valuable to Address?</h4>

I developed Sarana Point of Sales System to assist with my family’s small business, where a user-friendly and straightforward POS system was needed. The previous system was overly complex and difficult to manage, which made daily operations more challenging than necessary. Sarana was created to address these issues by providing a simple, intuitive interface that aligns perfectly with their specific needs.

The application is available in both Indonesian and English to cater to the local context in Indonesia, ensuring that the system is accessible and useful for my parents' business. Every feature in the app is designed with their operational quirks and requirements in mind, making Sarana a customized solution that simplifies their point-of-sale management while enhancing efficiency.
